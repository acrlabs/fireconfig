# ðŸ”¥Config Examples

## Workflows

The workflows directory contains a set of GitHub actions that you can use to have ðŸ”¥Config automatically compute the
mermaid DAG and diff of changes to your Kubernetes objects, and then leave a comment on the PR with the DAG and diff.
You _should_ just be able to copy these into your `.github/workflows` directory.  You'll need to set up a personal
access token (PAT) with read access to your actions and read and write access to pull requests.  This PAT then needs to
be injected into your actions as a GitHub secret.
